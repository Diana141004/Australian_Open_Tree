Implement a simple tournament management system for the Australian Open using binary trees. Players are inserted as leaves, and matches are represented by parent nodes. 
The program supports:
     - displaying the initial bracket,
     - finding the round in which two players could meet,
     - updating winners based on input scores,
     - identifying the longest match,
     - and determining the final champion.
